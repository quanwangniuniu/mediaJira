# Backend rules (Django / DRF / Celery / Channels)

## Keep views thin, services focused

- **Views**: parse input, permissions, call service layer, return response.
- **Serializers**: validate and normalize input/output; keep side effects out of serializers.
- **Services**: business logic goes in `services.py` (or a `services/` module if it grows).
  - In this repo, most apps follow the pattern `views.py` + `serializers.py` + `services.py` + `urls.py`—prefer that before inventing new layers.

## Database / ORM performance

- **Avoid N+1**: use `select_related` / `prefetch_related`.
- **Be explicit with transactions**: use `transaction.atomic()` for multi-write operations.
- **Prefer bulk ops when appropriate**: but keep correctness first (imports/large batches may justify bulk operations).

## API design

- **Consistent errors**: raise DRF `ValidationError` with field keys where possible.
- **Permissions first**: enforce auth/authorization early and consistently.

## Quality checks (backend)

- Run tests with `pytest` (coverage gate exists; don't lower it casually).
- Add tests for new endpoints/services and for bug fixes.
