# Core principles (non‑negotiable)

These rules are the default "how we build things" for this repo. Optimize for **KISS**: simplest thing that works, easy to review, easy to maintain.

- **Keep it small**: prefer many small files over one massive file.
- **Single responsibility**: one component/module should have one reason to change.
- **Thin edges, fat core**: pages/views/controllers stay thin; business logic lives in dedicated modules.
- **Consistency beats cleverness**: follow existing patterns in this repo even if you know another "better" way.
- **No secrets in git**: never commit `.env`, tokens, private keys, credentials.
