# Repo architecture (what goes where)

```text
backend/                     Django (DRF + Channels + Celery)
  <app>/                     One Django app per domain (task/, decision/, spreadsheet/, ...)
  backend/                   Django project (settings/urls/asgi/wsgi)

frontend/                    Next.js 14 (App Router)
  src/app/                   Route pages/layouts (compose, don't implement features here)
  src/components/            React components (feature folders live here)
    common/                  Shared, app-agnostic primitives (Button-like, Modal-like, ConfirmDialog, ...)
    ui/                      Reusable UI building blocks (Radix/shadcn-style wrappers)
    layout/                  App shell (Sidebar, Layout, navigation)
  src/lib/api/               All HTTP client code (Axios wrappers per domain)
