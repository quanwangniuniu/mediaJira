  version: 1.0.0
  description: |
    API specification for managing assets, versions, reviews, and comments.
    
    ## Asset Workflow
    Assets follow a Finite State Machine (FSM) workflow:
    - **Draft** → **PendingReview** (via submit)
    - **PendingReview** → **UnderReview** (via start_review)
    - **UnderReview** → **Approved** (via approve)
    - **UnderReview** → **Rejected** (via reject)
    - **Approved/Rejected** → **Archived** (via archive)
    
    The `status` field is read-only and managed by FSM transitions.
